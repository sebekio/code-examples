# code-examples

## Where to put things
- `trace/` = messy, fast capture (disposable)
- `notes/` = promoted, cleaned, kept

## Naming
`{topic}__{drill}__vN.{ext}`
Examples:
- `lis__dp1__v1.cpp`
- `argmax__loop__v1.py`

## Run
Open in Codespaces / VS Code Dev Container.
Then run via:
- VS Code: Tasks → “Run Current File (...)”
- Or scripts in `scripts/`

## Promote (binary rule)
Promotion = move file from `trace/...` → `notes/...`.
If it stays in `trace/`, it is allowed to be ugly and incomplete.
If it moves to `notes/`, it must be understandable later.
